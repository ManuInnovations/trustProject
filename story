I met my ex husband in Australia. We were together for a couple of years before conceiving our first child. When we had that child, we decided together that I would be the stay-at-home parent whilst my ex husband worked to support us financially for the first year. In terms of our families finances, my ex husband handled everything... I had joint access to one of his accounts and whatever was in that, was my budget for groceries, clothing, activities, gas etc... During this time it became clearer that the house we had been living in for three years was owned by a family trust. I didn’t ask too many questions.

Even in the first months of our separation, I never thought I wouldn’t be cared for financially. I was sure my ex husband valued and understood the importance of the “work” I had done as a full time Mum. I mean, we had decided that that was important together. I had put 6 years of my life into caring for our children with so much love and respect, keeping the house, doing the shopping and preparing healthy food with love. Our house, now referred to as “Grandma and Grandpa’s” house was worth over a million dollars. My ex husband lived there for a year before moving in with his new partner and renting out the house. It would get more than $900 a week in rent.

Three years later and I am still a beneficiary and living in a rental property. I have the children 5 nights a week. I work casually in school hours and I receive $220 per MONTH in child support for 2 children. At times I have attempted to ask for help with money to cover the costs of shoes, clothes or activities for the children. Mostly, it’s not worth the hassle. Asking only results in arguments, abuse and accusations from my ex husband such as “I don’t trust you around money”. I have lived with extreme financial strain for 3 years. This is exhausting and stressful for me.
