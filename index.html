            <h2>Current state of Trust Law in NZ</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="about_text">
            <p>NZ law allows property in a trust to be exempt from relationship property settlements. This means if you are not a co-trustee on the trust with relationship property, the contents of the trust won’t be considered in the settlement of relationship property after separation or divorce. Being a ‘discretionary trustee’ does not count.<br />
            Used wisely trusts can be a useful tool. The problem is how they are being mis-used and we think the law needs to be changed to protect those that need it most.</p>

          <p class="lead wow fadeIn" data-wow-delay="1s">“New Zealand’s relationship between trusts and relationship property is possibly more dysfunctional than a bad marriage. Whether intentionally or not, trusts can avoid claims even to property which would otherwise be shared, most often the family home.</br></br>

          That avenue of property protection can effectively subvert our “opt-out” regime, which intends for equal sharing to apply, unless couples have actively “contracted out” with independent legal advice for both. The principle that all eyes are wide open is subverted when one party has quietly opted out by utilising a trust.</br></br>

          The legislation also fails to include adequate remedies for those who have been unfairly cut out. There are still claims made to such trust property but they are expensive, inconsistent in outcome and dependent on a lottery of circumstances rather than clear principles of fairness.</br></br>

          Courts and lawyers have naturally utilised all tools available to help out. But the risk of that approach is that equity (an important tool of justice) is stretched to a point where some argue principle is lost.</br></br>

          The reform of the Property (Relationships) Act 1976 to properly address trust property is long overdue, and will hopefully save both the integrity of our contracting out system, trust law itself and maybe even some of the relationships involved."</br></br>

Just because you love someone in this moment, doesn’t mean you should trust him or her in the next. When relationships break down, people change. Seeking legal advice, either as a couple or separately, at least gives you a clear understanding of what you are walking into and what you will walk out with (if anything).</p>
