                        <p>I met my ex-husband in Australia. We were together for a couple of years before conceiving our first child. When we had that child, we decided together that I would be the stay-at-home parent whilst he worked to support us financially for the first year.</p>
                        <p>In terms of our families finances, my ex-husband handled everything. I had joint access to one of his accounts and whatever was in that, was my budget for groceries, clothing, activities, gas etc.</p>
                        <p>During this time it became clearer that the house we had been living in for three years was owned by his family trust. I didn’t ask too many questions.</p>

                        <p>Even in the first months of our separation, I never thought I wouldn’t be cared for financially. I was sure my ex-husband valued and understood the importance of the “work” I had done as a full time Mum. I mean, we had decided that that was important together.</p>
                        <p>I had put six years of my life into caring for our children with so much love and respect, keeping the house, doing the shopping and preparing healthy food. Our house, now referred to as “Grandma and Grandpa’s” house was worth over a million dollars.</p>
                        <p>My ex-husband lived there for a year before moving in with his new partner and renting out the house. It would get more than $900 a week in rent.</p>

                        <p>At times I have attempted to ask him for help with money to cover the costs of shoes, clothes or activities for the children. Mostly, it’s not worth the hassle. Asking only results in arguments, abuse and accusations from my ex-husband such as “I don’t trust you around money”.</p>
                        <p>I have lived with extreme financial strain for three years. This is exhausting and stressful for me.</p>

              <h2>About the Trust Project</h2>
              <p>Do the current laws around Trusts disadvantage women and children?
                Are NZ taxpayers paying millions of dollars annually to support families when one partner absconds
                financial responsibility through the use of trusts?
                We want to find out.</p><br/>
                <p>The Trust Project aims to gather the stories of people who have been negatively impacted by the current law that allows property in a Trust to be exempt from relationship property settlements. We want to lobby for a change in the law and raise awareness about the current laws around trusts.</p><br/>
                <p>There is a Trusts Bill due to be read in Parliament so time is of the essence. Also, the Law Commission has just announced they recommend a reform of the law around property division including trusts. Tell your story! Help by putting the call out for others to share their stories.</p><br />
                <h2>Current state of Trust Law in NZ</h2>
                <p>NZ law allows property in a trust to be exempt from relationship property settlements. This means if you are not a co-trustee on the trust with relationship property, the contents of the trust won’t be considered in the settlement of relationship property after separation or divorce. Being a ‘discretionary trustee’ does not count.<br />
                  Used wisely trusts can be a useful tool. The problem is how they are being mis-used and we think the law needs to be changed to protect those that need it most.

                <p class="lead wow fadeIn" data-wow-delay="1s">“New Zealand’s relationship between trusts and relationship property is possibly more dysfunctional than a bad marriage. Whether intentionally or not, trusts can avoid claims even to property which would otherwise be shared, most often the family home.</p></br>

                <p class="lead wow fadeIn" data-wow-delay="2s">That avenue of property protection can effectively subvert our “opt-out” regime, which intends for equal sharing to apply, unless couples have actively “contracted out” with independent legal advice for both. The principle that all eyes are wide open is subverted when one party has quietly opted out by utilising a trust.</p></br>

                <p class="lead wow fadeIn" data-wow-delay="3s">The legislation also fails to include adequate remedies for those who have been unfairly cut out.
                There are still claims made to such trust property but they are expensive, inconsistent in outcome and dependent on a lottery of circumstances rather than clear principles of fairness.</p></br>

                <p class="lead wow fadeIn" data-wow-delay="4s">Courts and lawyers have naturally utilised all tools available to help out. But the risk of that approach is that equity (an important tool of justice) is stretched to a point where some argue principle is lost.</p></br>

                <p class="lead wow fadeIn" data-wow-delay="5s">The reform of the Property (Relationships) Act 1976 to property address trust property is long overdue, and will hopefully save both the integrity of our contracting out system, trust law itself and maybe even some of the relationships involved." </p>

Just because you love someone in this moment, doesn’t mean you should trust him or her in the next. When relationships break down, people change. Seeking legal advice, either as a couple or separately, at least gives you a clear understanding of what you are walking into and what you will walk out with (if anything).</p>
